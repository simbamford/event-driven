Visualise a stream of events either from real hardware/camera or from a pre-\/recorded sequence.

\subsection*{Description}

This application demonstrates how to visualise a stream of address events either from the cameras or from a pre-\/recorded sequence. The event stream is transmitted from the cameras ({\ttfamily /zynq\+Grabber/\+AE\+:o}) to the v\+Pre\+Process ({\ttfamily /v\+Pre\+Process/\+AE\+:i}), that removes salt-\/and-\/pepper noise from the event stream. The filtered stream ({\ttfamily /v\+Pre\+Process/left\+:o} and {\ttfamily /v\+Pre\+Process/right\+:o}) is sent to v\+Framer ({\ttfamily /v\+Framer/left/\+AE\+:i}), that converts it to a yarpview-\/able image. The \char`\"{}images\char`\"{} from left ({\ttfamily /v\+Framer/left/image\+:o}) and right camera ({\ttfamily /v\+Framer/right/image\+:o}) are then sent to the yarp viewers ({\ttfamily /view\+Ch0} and {\ttfamily /view\+Ch1}).

Here is a visualisation of the instantiated modules and connections.



\subsection*{How to run the application}

These are basic instructions for first time Y\+A\+RP users, assuming the comprehensive instructions have been followed.

\subsubsection*{Using actual hardware/camera? Skip \href{#using-real-hardwarecamera}{\tt ahead}. Using a dataset? Follow these instructions\+:}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Download the sample dataset from \href{https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.2556755}{\tt here} and unpack to a location of your choosing.
\item Set the yarp namespace\+: 
\begin{DoxyCode}
yarp namespace /<yourname>
\end{DoxyCode}

\item Run a yarpserver\+: 
\begin{DoxyCode}
yarpserver --write
\end{DoxyCode}

\item In a separate terminal, run a yarpdataplayer\+: 
\begin{DoxyCode}
yarpdataplayer
\end{DoxyCode}

\item In the yarpdataplayer gui, open the downloaded datsets (File-\/$>$open) by pressing \char`\"{}\+Choose\char`\"{} on the upper-\/level folder (e.\+g. folder name\+: fasthandtrim).
\item The dataset should be open in the yarpdataplayer window with a \char`\"{}\+Port Name\char`\"{} of {\ttfamily /zynq\+Grabber/\+AE\+:o}.
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsubsection*{Using real hardware/camera?}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item You should have followed the instructions to run install hardware and run zynq\+Grabber.
\item If everything went smoothly, your laptop should be connected to the {\ttfamily yarpserver} running on the Z\+CB, your zynq\+Grabber should be running and a port {\ttfamily /zynq\+Grabber/\+AE\+:o} should be already open (check with {\ttfamily yarp name list}).
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsubsection*{Okay -\/ yarpdataplayer users, and hardware users back together here\+:}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item In a separate terminal, run a yarpmanager\+: 
\begin{DoxyCode}
yarpmanager
\end{DoxyCode}

\item The yarpmanager gui should be open.
\item On the entities tab (left) open the \char`\"{}\+Applications\char`\"{} folder -\/ the v\+View application should be visible. Double click the {\ttfamily event-\/viewer-\/example} application to load it.
\item If you do not have the {\ttfamily event-\/viewer-\/example} application, make sure you followed the installation steps correctly, and that your {\ttfamily Y\+A\+R\+P\+\_\+\+D\+A\+T\+A\+\_\+\+D\+I\+RS} environment variable correctly points to the share folders in your install folder ({\ttfamily echo \$\+Y\+A\+R\+P\+\_\+\+D\+A\+T\+A\+\_\+\+D\+I\+RS})
\item Run all the modules in the {\ttfamily event-\/viewer-\/example} app by choosing \char`\"{}\+Run All\char`\"{} in the left-\/most vertical toolbar. All applications should become green.
\item If not all applications are green, it means the executable files could not be found on the {\ttfamily P\+A\+TH}. Verfify your installation and your {\ttfamily P\+A\+TH} environment variable ({\ttfamily echo \$\+P\+A\+TH}).
\item Connect all yarp ports by choosing \char`\"{}\+Connect All\char`\"{} in the same toolbar. All connections should turn green.
\item Press \char`\"{}\+Play\char`\"{} on the yarpdataplayer. The dataset should be visible in the yarpview windows (split into left and right cameras).
\item To close all applications first \char`\"{}\+Disconnect All\char`\"{} and then \char`\"{}\+Close All\char`\"{} on the left-\/hand toolbar. G\+UI\textquotesingle{}s are closed as per a normal window. The yarpserver can be closed using {\ttfamily ctrl+c} in the appropriate terminal.
